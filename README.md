# Global-Routing(ntust_algorithom_pa2)
## Problem Description
This programming assignment asks you to write a global router that can route 2-pin nets (connection between two points). The problem description below is a simplified routing problem. Given the problem size (the number of horizontal and vertical tiles), capacity, and a netlist, the global router routes all nets in the routing region. The main objective is to minimize the total overflows. Here the overflow on a tile boundary is calculated as the amount of demand that excesses the capacity, i.e., overflow = max(0, demand-capacity).
